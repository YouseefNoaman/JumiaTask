##improvements##
- need to correct the filter text input, as it is now under the filter word.
- need to activate sorting on the data, it works by animation only, not sorting the data.
- need to activate the pagination in the frontend.
- need to activate sorting from the backend and works on the frontend, it works at the backend only.
